# Paper hands

Are you tired of fumbling your bags, selling way to early because you have the
conviction of a teaspoon ?
Or are you just an addict degen that **has** to margin trade his bags if they
are liquid, bringing shame and poverty onto you family for generations ?

### Solution: 
- Lock away your ERC20 and ETH funds (including wrapped assets), while earning yield on them through DEFI
- Unlock them on any of those conditions :
  - Price has reached an ambitious target you had in mind and you want to sell
  - A predetermined duration has passed : you didn't lose it all on leverage like a monkey
  - Your trusted friend, with more conviction than you, also decides that it's 
  a good time to unlock, and signs a transaction to allow you to access you funds
